More commands - not yet in a script... but easy for DIY:

Shuffle on/off:

CMD='{"type":"ShuffleCommand","shuffle":true}'

CMD='{"type":"ShuffleCommand","shuffle":false}'

Repeat on/off:

CMD='{"type":"RepeatCommand","repeat":true}'

CMD='{"type":"RepeatCommand","repeat":false}'

+30Sek / -30Sek (e.g. for Books)

CMD='{"type":"ForwardCommand"}'

CMD='{"type":"RewindCommand"}'

Adapted for me.
